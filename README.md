
Unshaql -

A client tool to try out SPARQL queries to the Sheffield air Quality Agent endpoint.

At present it simply supports testing quesries, selecting output format
and obtaining a link to re-use. 

In time we would like to develop its capability to save / manage the queries tested.

By the way, we picked the name unshaql because it sounds cool for a tool to liberate data :)
