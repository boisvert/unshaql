
Unshaql -

A client tool to try out SPARQL queries to the Sheffield air Quality Agent endpoint.

At present it simply supports testing queries, selecting output format
and obtaining a link to re-use. 

In time we would like to develop its capability to save / manage the queries tested.

I picked the name unshaql for "Sheffield air quality" because it sounds cool for a sparql tool to liberate data :)
